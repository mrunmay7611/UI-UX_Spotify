**Case Study**: Spotify for Mood-Based Customization

**Introduction**

In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, music is often a companion to our emotions. However, existing music streaming platforms lack a focused approach to adapt content to users' current moods. This project reimagines Spotify as a mood-driven music experience, allowing users to seamlessly connect their emotions with personalized playlists and insightful tools for emotional well-being.

**roject Overview**

**Objective**: To redesign Spotify to offer a mood-driven music experience, providing users with mood-based playlists, interactive visuals, and personalized insights.

**Target Audience**: Music listeners who seek emotionally resonant content tailored to their state of mind, ranging from casual users to those looking for emotional balance and mindfulness.

**Key Features:**
**1.Mood Selector Wheel:** A visually intuitive interface for selecting moods like Happy, Sad, Energetic, or Relaxed.
**2.Dynamic Playlists:** Real-time playlist generation based on the selected mood.
**3.Emotion Tracking:** User feedback to refine playlist recommendations.
**4.Daily Mood Journal:** A personal log to track moods and the music that influenced them.

**Design Process**

**1. Research**
User Interviews: Conducted interviews with 5-6 Spotify users to understand their listening behaviors and emotional triggers.
Key insight: Users often choose music to match or shift their moods but find it cumbersome to discover mood-specific playlists.

**2. Problem Statement**
Users need a way to effortlessly discover and enjoy music tailored to their emotional state because current platforms lack intuitive tools for mood-based music selection.
**3.Wireframing & Prototyping**
Created low-fidelity wireframes to map the user flow:
   1.Mood selection.
   2.Playlist discovery.
   3.Music playback with mood-aligned visuals.
   4.Mood tracking and journaling.
Developed high-fidelity prototypes in Figma with animations for smooth transitions.

**Key Screens**

**1. Mood Selector Wheel**
**Description:** A circular wheel segmented into moods (e.g., Happy, Sad, Energetic).
**Functionality:**
    Users drag or tap on a segment to select their mood.
    The wheel animates softly when interacted with, enhancing the emotional connection.

**2. Playlist Screen**
**Description:** Displays curated playlists dynamically generated based on the chosen mood.
**Key Features:** 
    Playlist titles and album covers reflect the mood visually (e.g., warm colors for Happy, cool tones for Relaxed).
    Quick play and shuffle buttons for easy access.

**Conclusion**

The redesigned Spotify for Mood-Based Customization successfully bridges the gap between music and emotions. By offering an intuitive mood selection tool, dynamic playlists, and personalized emotional insights, it creates a richer and more meaningful user experience. This project highlights the potential of UX design to foster deeper emotional connections in digital products.
